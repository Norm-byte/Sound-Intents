Harmony Admin (Flutter Web)

Quick start (very simple):

Requirements:
- Flutter SDK installed and on PATH
- Chrome browser for `flutter run -d chrome`

Run locally (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\norms\OneDrive\Desktop\CommunityApps\harmony by intent\harmony-by-intent\src\admin"
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome
```

Build for web:

```powershell
flutter build web
```

Notes:
- This is a minimal scaffold (placeholder UI) to start the Admin Web app.
- No Firebase or Gemini credentials are configured. I can add stubs when you confirm credentials or we can keep them as placeholders.
- To share code on GitHub, run `git init` in this folder and push to your repository (you said you have GitHub on this computer).
